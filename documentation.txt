I implemented all the 10 basic features and I also implement an additional feature: email.

Additional:Support emailing updates, where any answer posted will get sent to the person asking the question. In my app, the user who answer the question will send an email to the author of question.

I created a new branch experiment, which turns off the RSS link.

1.The system handle multiple users. You could login and logout through the login and logout link on the MainPage and View Page. Each user could create question,answer them, or vote.

2.User could edit the question and answer they have created through the “Edit this question” link and “Edit this answer” link on View Page. And they could change the votes on View page.

3.On the Main Page, we could see 10 questions with a link to go to the next page of older questions.

4.Answers are sorted by largest difference between up and down votes on View page.

5.You could give 0 or more tags when create or edit question. You could see all questions or only questions with a specific tag.

6.When question or answer contain links:
if the link is end with .jpg,.png,or .gif, it display image;
else it display html link.

7.You could upload image on the Main Page; it has an “Upload Image” link. The image will have an [img:imagekey]. If you put this in question or answer’s content, it will display this image.

8.Each question capped at 500 characters and has a “permalink”.

9.Questions an answers has a timestamp showing the creating time. They also have edited time. When you edit the question and answer, the original contents will fill in the form by default.

10.Each question has an RSS link, dumping all questions and answers in XML.
